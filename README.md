## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact/Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

‚Ä¢ A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
‚Ä¢ Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
‚Ä¢ Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
‚Ä¢ Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
‚Ä¢ Market price tracking.
‚Ä¢ Voice support for low-literate users.
‚Ä¢ Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

‚Ä¢ Small and marginal farmers
‚Ä¢ Agricultural extension officers
‚Ä¢ Government agriculture departments
‚Ä¢ NGOs and cooperatives
‚Ä¢ Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

‚Ä¢ 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
‚Ä¢ Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20‚Äì30%.

<h3>SOLUTION</h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;>
 Farmers can be provided with ai mobile app which ensures the eligibility of the soil to grow crops.Farmers can walk in, speak in their native language, and get personalized advice. No smartphone needed‚Äîfarmers can call a toll-free number and talk to the AI in their dialect. Uses speech recognition and natural language processing to deliver crop, soil, and weather advice.It also can call even for updates and requirements.
</p>
<h3>Farmer-to-Farmer Learning Network</h3>
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;>
Verified farmers can upload short voice notes or videos sharing what worked for them.AI curates and translates these into region-specific tips. Builds trust by amplifying local success stories.Farmers receive NFC-enabled smart cards with their soil profile, crop history, and advisory logs. Can be scanned at kiosks or by extension officers for instant updates. Works even in low-connectivity zones. Combines satellite data, weather APIs, and local sensor inputs (where available). Predicts pest outbreaks, rainfall, and optimal sowing windows with high accuracy.

## Feasibility and Viability
```
<p style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;>
  AI, NLP, and voice tech are mature enough to support multilingual, voice-first interfaces. Smartphones and mobile networks are increasingly accessible in rural India. Cloud infrastructure allows scalable deployment of advisory services. Soil health cards, weather APIs, satellite imagery, and crop databases are available through government and private channels. Farmer input and usage data can be collected to improve recommendations over time.Voice-based interfaces and dial-in systems can bypass literacy and smartphone barriers. NGOs, agri-cooperatives, and government extension programs are eager collaborators. Agri-tech startups can provide technical expertise and innovation.
